This project is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Hangman word-guessing game using Python. 
The player tries to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. 
The game displays the word with blanks, updates correct guesses, and draws parts of the hangman figure for each wrong guess. 
The program uses basic Python concepts such as loops, conditionals, string manipulation, and lists. 
It also includes random word selection from a predefined list to increase replayability. 
The game logic ensures real-time feedback to the user, tracks guesses, and ends with a win or loss message
